## Platform Architecture Overview

EllaAI is a B2B SaaS recruitment assessment platform with the following structure:
- **Ella (Platform Provider)**: Provides the platform to multiple customer companies
- **Customer Companies**: Organizations that use EllaAI to assess candidates
- **Multi-tenancy**: Each customer company has isolated data and users
- **Role-based Access**: Different user types with specific permissions within each tenant

## User Types and Roles

### 1. Ella Platform Admin (`ella_admin`)
- **Scope**: Platform-wide access across all customer companies
- **Purpose**: Platform management, onboarding, support, and oversight
- **Access Level**: Super admin with restricted operational controls

### 2. Customer Company Recruiter (`recruiter`)
- **Scope**: Limited to their own company's data
- **Purpose**: Day-to-day recruitment operations
- **Access Level**: Full CRUD operations within company scope

### 3. Customer Company Hiring Manager (`hiring_manager`)
- **Scope**: Limited to their own company's data with view/approve permissions
- **Purpose**: Review candidates and make hiring decisions
- **Access Level**: Read access with approval workflows

### 4. Candidate (`candidate`)
- **Scope**: Personal assessment data and public job applications
- **Purpose**: Apply for positions and take assessments
- **Access Level**: Self-service with limited data visibility

## Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

### Data Partitioning Strategy
```typescript
interface TenantIsolation {
  companyId: string;          // Unique identifier for each customer company
  dataPartitioning: {
    assessments: `${companyId}/assessments/*`;
    candidates: `${companyId}/candidates/*`;
    positions: `${companyId}/positions/*`;
    results: `${companyId}/results/*`;
    invitations: `${companyId}/invitations/*`;
  };
  userAccess: {
    companyUsers: string[];   // Array of user IDs belonging to this company
    crossCompanyAccess: boolean; // Only true for ella_admin
  };
}
```

### Security Model
- **Row-Level Security**: All queries filtered by `companyId`
- **API Authentication**: JWT tokens include `companyId` and role
- **Frontend Routing**: Role-based route guards
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
