# AI Agent Handover Document - EllaAI Firebase Migration

## Project Overview
The EllaAI platform is a recruitment assessment system that has been migrated from a legacy backend to Firebase. The frontend is built with React + TypeScript + Vite and deployed on Vercel.

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/delimatsuo/ellaai-firebase-migration
**Live Deployment**: https://ellaai-frontend.vercel.app
**Working Directory**: `/frontend` (all paths below are relative to this)

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Tasks
1. **Firebase Authentication Fixed**: Successfully resolved Firebase SDK initialization issues by loading from CDN
2. **Production Deployment**: App is live on Vercel and loading successfully
3. **Admin User Created**: System admin account exists in Firebase
4. **WebSocket Issues Resolved**: Blocked localhost connections in production
5. **React JSX Build Fixed**: Resolved production build configuration issues

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issue - User Cannot Login
Despite fixing authentication and creating the admin user, login is still failing. The user sees the login page but cannot authenticate.

**Admin Credentials**:
- Email: `deli@ellaexecutivesearch.com`
- Password: `convidado`
- Firebase UID: `Wvr2g8taKwSbLk2yma9psE1sf6F2`

## Technical Details

### Firebase Configuration
- **Project**: `ellaai-platform-prod`
- **Loading Method**: CDN via index.html (to bypass Vite bundling issues)
- **Version**: Firebase SDK v12.1.0 (compat mode)

### Key Files to Review

1. **Firebase Config**: `src/firebase/config.ts`
   - Uses CDN-loaded Firebase from window object
   - Provides mock implementations until CDN loads

2. **Auth Context**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
   - Modified to use CDN Firebase instances
   - All methods updated to use compat API

3. **Index HTML**: `index.html`
   - Loads Firebase SDK from CDN
   - Initializes Firebase before app loads

4. **Admin Setup Tools**: `public/make-admin.html`
   - Tool for granting admin permissions
   - Currently fails due to API key restrictions

## Known Issues & Next Steps

### 1. Authentication Not Working (PRIORITY)
**Problem**: User cannot login despite Firebase being loaded and user existing in both Authentication and Firestore.

**Debug Steps**:
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Verify Firebase Auth is properly initialized from CDN
- Check if auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword is being called correctly
- Verify Firestore security rules allow reading user documents
- Check if the authentication state change listener is working

**Potential Solutions**:
- May need to ensure Firebase is fully loaded before React app initializes
- Check if there's a race condition between CDN loading and app initialization
- Verify the email/password authentication method is enabled in Firebase Console

### 2. Firestore Permissions
**Current State**: User document exists with these fields:
```javascript
{
  uid: "Wvr2g8taKwSbLk2yma9psE1sf6F2",
  email: "deli@ellaexecutivesearch.com",
  displayName: "System Administrator",
  role: "system_admin",
  permissions: {
    canManageUsers: true,
    canManageCompanies: true,
    canViewAllData: true,
    canAccessAdminPanel: true,
    canManageSystem: true
  },
  isSystemAdmin: true,
  isActive: true,
  emailVerified: true
}
```

### 3. API Key Restrictions
The Firebase API key has restrictions that prevent certain operations from web clients. This affects:
- Creating users programmatically
- Certain Firestore write operations

## Environment Variables (Vercel)
All Firebase config values are set in Vercel environment variables:
- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

## Development Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev  # Local development
npm run build  # Production build
vercel  # Deploy to Vercel
```

## Testing Authentication
1. Open https://ellaai-frontend.vercel.app
2. Enter credentials (deli@ellaexecutivesearch.com / convidado)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Network tab should show requests to identitytoolkit.googleapis.com

## File Structure
```

â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AuthContext.tsx   # Authentication context

```

## Debugging Commands
```bash
# Check Firebase configuration
cat src/firebase/config.ts

# Check authentication context
cat src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx

# View recent changes
git log --oneline -10

# Check deployment logs
vercel logs

# Test locally
npm run dev
```

## Contact & Resources
- **Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com
- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/deli-matsuos-projects
- **GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/delimatsuo/ellaai-firebase-migration

## Priority Action Items
1. **Fix Authentication**: Debug why login fails despite correct setup
2. **Verify Firebase Initialization**: Ensure CDN loading completes before auth attempts
3. **Check Security Rules**: Verify Firestore rules allow authenticated reads
4. **Test Auth Flow**: Add console logs to trace the authentication process
5. **Consider Alternative**: If CDN approach continues to fail, consider server-side auth proxy

## Notes for Next Agent
- User is frustrated with authentication not working after multiple attempts
- The Firebase CDN approach was chosen to bypass Vite bundling issues
- Original error was "Firebase Installations API returning 400 INVALID_ARGUMENT"
- User successfully created account in Firebase Console manually
- Firestore document exists with proper admin permissions
- Focus on getting the login working - this is the critical blocker
