# 🎯 EllaAI Technical Assessment Platform - Feature-Complete Requirements

**Platform Purpose:** Technical skills assessment for software engineers  
**Integration Model:** Works alongside existing ATS systems  
**Core Value:** Provide deep technical evaluation data back to hiring teams

## 📋 Revised Understanding

EllaAI is NOT an ATS replacement but rather a **specialized technical assessment layer** that:
- Receives candidates from client's existing ATS (Greenhouse, Lever, etc.)
- Runs them through customized technical assessments
- Returns detailed evaluation results to the client's hiring workflow

## ✅ What's Already Built (Production-Ready)

### Core Infrastructure ✓
- Multi-tenant architecture with company isolation
- User management with role-based access (Admin, Recruiter, Hiring Manager, Candidate)
- Authentication and security (Firebase Auth + Security Rules)
- Company lifecycle management (creation, suspension, closure)
- Acting As mode for support
- Audit logging and compliance tracking

### Basic Assessment Flow ✓
- Assessment data models
- Candidate management structure
- API endpoints for assessment operations
- Results storage and retrieval

## 🔴 Critical Missing Features for MVP

### 1. **Assessment Execution Engine** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
Currently missing the actual assessment-taking functionality.

**Required Components:**
```typescript
interface AssessmentEngine {
  // Code execution environment
  codeRunner: {
    languages: ['JavaScript', 'Python', 'Java', 'Go', 'Ruby'],
    sandboxEnvironment: 'Docker/Firebase Functions',
    timeoutProtection: true,
    memoryLimits: true
  },
  
  // Assessment types
  assessmentTypes: {
    codingChallenge: true,      // Write code to solve problems
    codeReview: true,           // Review and fix existing code
    systemDesign: true,         // Architecture diagrams/explanations
    sqlChallenges: true,        // Database query problems
    debuggingExercise: true,    // Find and fix bugs
    multipleChoice: true       // Technical knowledge questions
  },
  
  // Proctoring features
  proctoring: {
    copyPasteDetection: true,
    tabSwitchMonitoring: true,
    screenshotCapture: false,  // Optional for privacy
    timeLimits: true,
    attemptRestrictions: true
  }
}
```

### 2. **Question Bank & Templates** (CRITICAL)
No pre-built assessment content exists.

**Required Content:**
- **Starter Library:** 50+ validated coding problems by difficulty
- **Language-Specific:** Problems for each supported language
- **Role Templates:** Frontend, Backend, Full-Stack, DevOps, Data Engineer
- **Difficulty Levels:** Junior (L1), Mid (L2), Senior (L3), Staff (L4)
- **Time Estimates:** Each question with recommended time allocation

### 3. **Code Evaluation System** (CRITICAL)
Missing automated evaluation of submissions.

**Required Components:**
```typescript
interface CodeEvaluator {
  // Automated testing
  testCases: {
    visible: TestCase[],    // Shown to candidate
    hidden: TestCase[],     // Not shown, prevents gaming
    edge: TestCase[],       // Edge cases for thoroughness
    performance: TestCase[] // Big-O complexity validation
  },
  
  // Scoring system
  scoring: {
    correctness: number,     // Did it work?
    efficiency: number,      // How fast?
    codeQuality: number,     // Clean, readable?
    edgeCases: number,      // Handle exceptions?
    testCoverage: number    // Did they write tests?
  },
  
  // Partial credit
  partialScoring: boolean   // Credit for approach even if not perfect
}
```

### 4. **Results Dashboard & Reporting** (CRITICAL)
Limited ability to view and interpret results.

**Required Features:**
- **Candidate Report Card:** Technical strengths/weaknesses breakdown
- **Comparative Analytics:** How candidate ranks against others
- **Code Playback:** Review how candidate solved the problem
- **Detailed Feedback:** Auto-generated insights on code quality
- **Export Options:** PDF reports, API webhook to ATS

### 5. **ATS Integration Layer** (HIGH)
No way to seamlessly connect with client's existing ATS.

**Required Integrations:**
```typescript
interface ATSIntegration {
  // Inbound - receive candidates
  inbound: {
    webhookReceiver: true,      // Receive candidate when tagged in ATS
    csvImport: true,            // Bulk import candidate lists
    emailInvites: true,         // Send assessment links via email
    apiEndpoint: true           // REST API for candidate creation
  },
  
  // Outbound - return results
  outbound: {
    webhookNotification: true,  // Push results when complete
    apiPolling: true,           // ATS can poll for results
    emailReports: true,         // Email PDF to hiring manager
    scorePassback: true        // Update candidate score in ATS
  },
  
  // Native integrations
  platforms: {
    greenhouse: { status: 'planned', oAuth: true },
    lever: { status: 'planned', oAuth: true },
    workday: { status: 'future', enterprise: true },
    generic: { status: 'ready', apiKey: true }
  }
}
```

## ✅ Definition of "Feature-Complete"

The platform is feature-complete when:

1. **Candidates can:**
   - Receive assessment invitation
   - Complete coding challenges in multiple languages
   - Submit and test their code
   - Receive confirmation of completion

2. **Recruiters can:**
   - Create/customize assessments
   - Send invitations to candidates
   - View detailed results and reports
   - Export data to their ATS

3. **The platform can:**
   - Execute code safely and reliably
   - Score submissions automatically
   - Generate insightful reports
   - Integrate with at least one major ATS

4. **Quality standards:**
   - 99.9% uptime
   - <5% false positive rate
   - >85% completion rate
   - <30 minute integration time

## 📝 Conclusion

To have a **feature-complete technical assessment platform** ready for production testing, the focus should be on:

1. **Building the assessment engine** (code execution, testing)
2. **Creating a question bank** (validated problems with test cases)
3. **Implementing automated scoring** (fair, consistent evaluation)
4. **Developing results reporting** (actionable insights for clients)
5. **Enabling ATS integration** (seamless workflow connection)

This is a much more focused scope than a full ATS replacement and can be achieved in 8 weeks with a dedicated team. The platform would then provide real value by handling the complex technical assessment portion of hiring while integrating smoothly with existing recruiting workflows.

**Note:** This revised understanding significantly simplifies the requirements and makes the platform much more achievable in the near term. The focus shifts from "recruitment platform" to "technical assessment specialist" which is a clearer value proposition and easier to deliver.
