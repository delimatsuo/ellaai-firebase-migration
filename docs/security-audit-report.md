## CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES (Must Fix Before Production)

### üö® CRITICAL-001: Service Account Private Key Exposed in Repository
**File:** `/config/service-account-key.json`  
**Impact:** Complete system compromise  
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL

**Finding:** 
The Firebase service account private key is stored in plaintext in the repository with production credentials exposed:
```
"project_id": "ellaai-platform-prod"
"private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEuwIBADANBgkqhkiG..."
```

**Remediation:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** regenerate this service account key
2. Remove the file from repository history using `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
3. Store service account credentials as environment variables or use Google Cloud Secret Manager
4. Use workload identity federation for Cloud Functions
5. Add `.json` files containing credentials to `.gitignore`

### üö® CRITICAL-002: Unrestricted Admin Endpoints
**File:** `/functions/src/routes/auth.ts` (Lines 154-202)  
**Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access  
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL

**Finding:**
Admin-only endpoints `/api/auth/custom-token` and `/api/auth/set-claims` have no authentication middleware:
```typescript
router.post('/custom-token', validateRequest(createCustomTokenSchema), ...)
router.post('/set-claims', validateRequest(updateUserClaimsSchema), ...)
```

**Remediation:**
1. Add `authMiddleware` and `requireRole(['admin'])` to all admin endpoints
2. Implement IP whitelisting for admin functions
3. Add audit logging for all privilege escalation operations
4. Consider requiring multi-factor authentication for admin operations

### üö® CRITICAL-003: Firebase Rules Allow Privilege Escalation
**File:** `/firestore.rules` (Lines 16-17, 27-29)  
**Impact:** Horizontal privilege escalation  
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL

**Finding:**
Firestore rules allow users to write to company documents and assessments if they have any company access, without validating write permissions:
```javascript
allow write: if request.auth != null && 
  (resource.data.admins[request.auth.uid] == true ||
   get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin');
```

**Remediation:**
1. Separate read and write permissions more granularly
2. Validate that users can only modify documents they have explicit permission to edit
3. Add field-level validation to prevent unauthorized data changes
4. Implement resource-level access control lists (ACLs)

---

## HIGH-RISK ISSUES (Should Fix)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH-001: Session Management Vulnerabilities
**Files:** `/functions/src/routes/auth.ts`, `/functions/src/middleware/auth.ts`  
**Impact:** Session hijacking, CSRF attacks  
**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Finding:**
- Session cookies lack secure configuration for production
- No CSRF protection implemented
- Session validation doesn't check for concurrent sessions

**Remediation:**
1. Enable `secure: true` for production cookies
2. Implement CSRF protection using `csurf` middleware
3. Add session fingerprinting and concurrent session detection
4. Implement proper session rotation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH-002: Insufficient Input Validation
**File:** `/functions/src/middleware/validation.ts`  
**Impact:** Injection attacks, data corruption  
**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Finding:**
- Password validation is too weak (only requires 8 chars + basic pattern)
- No SQL/NoSQL injection protection for dynamic queries
- File upload validation missing

**Remediation:**
1. Strengthen password requirements (minimum 12 characters, complexity rules)
2. Implement parameterized queries for all database operations
3. Add file type and size validation for uploads
4. Sanitize all user inputs using DOMPurify or similar

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH-003: Rate Limiting Insufficient for Auth Endpoints  
**File:** `/functions/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts`  
**Impact:** Brute force attacks, DoS  
**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Finding:**
- In-memory rate limiting won't scale and resets on function cold start
- Auth rate limit (5 requests/15min) may be too permissive for failed attempts
- No account lockout mechanism

**Remediation:**
1. Implement Redis-based rate limiting for production
2. Add progressive delays for failed authentication attempts
3. Implement account lockout after repeated failures
4. Add IP-based blocking for suspicious activity

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH-004: Missing Security Headers and CSP
**File:** `/functions/src/index.ts`  
**Impact:** XSS, clickjacking attacks  
**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Finding:**
- CSP policy too permissive (`'unsafe-inline'` for styles)
- Missing security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- No integrity checks for external resources

**Remediation:**
1. Remove `'unsafe-inline'` from CSP and use nonces/hashes
2. Add comprehensive security headers using Helmet
3. Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external assets
4. Add HSTS headers for HTTPS enforcement

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH-005: Firestore Rules Performance Issues
**File:** `/firestore.rules`  
**Impact:** DoS via expensive queries  
**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Finding:**
- Multiple `get()` operations in rules can cause performance issues
- No limits on query complexity
- Rules may execute expensive lookups for every document access

**Remediation:**
1. Cache user role/permissions in custom claims to avoid `get()` calls
2. Implement query complexity limits
3. Add monitoring for rule execution performance
4. Consider using Cloud Functions for complex authorization logic

## MEDIUM-RISK ISSUES (Recommended Fixes)

### ‚ö° MEDIUM-001: Error Information Leakage
**File:** `/functions/src/middleware/errorHandler.ts`  
**Impact:** Information disclosure  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Finding:**
Stack traces and internal error details exposed in non-production environments may leak in production due to misconfigured NODE_ENV.

**Remediation:**
1. Ensure NODE_ENV is properly set in all environments
2. Implement structured logging with appropriate log levels
3. Create separate error responses for internal vs. external errors

### ‚ö° MEDIUM-002: Missing Audit Trail
**File:** `/functions/src/middleware/audit.ts`  
**Impact:** Compliance, forensics  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Finding:**
- Insufficient audit logging for sensitive operations
- No integrity protection for audit logs
- Missing user activity tracking

**Remediation:**
1. Implement comprehensive audit logging for all CRUD operations
2. Add log integrity verification using digital signatures
3. Implement real-time monitoring for suspicious activities

### ‚ö° MEDIUM-003: Frontend API Key Exposure
**File:** `/frontend/.env`  
**Impact:** API abuse, quota exhaustion  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Finding:**
Firebase API keys are exposed in frontend environment variables (expected but should be restricted).

**Remediation:**
1. Configure Firebase project to restrict API key usage by domain
2. Implement API key rotation policy
3. Monitor API usage for abuse patterns

### ‚ö° MEDIUM-004: Dependency Vulnerabilities
**Impact:** Various security risks  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Finding:**
Frontend has 15 moderate severity vulnerabilities in dependencies:
- esbuild: SSRF vulnerability (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)  
- undici: RNG and DoS vulnerabilities

**Remediation:**
1. Run `npm audit fix` to update vulnerable packages
2. Implement automated dependency scanning in CI/CD
3. Set up Dependabot or similar for automated security updates

## LOW-RISK ISSUES (Security Improvements)

### üìå LOW-001: Environment File Permissions
World-readable environment files could expose sensitive configuration.

**Remediation:** Set restrictive permissions (600) on all `.env` files.

### üìå LOW-002: Console Logging in Production
Multiple files contain console.log statements that may leak information in production.

**Remediation:** Implement structured logging and remove console statements.

### üìå LOW-003: Missing Request ID Tracking
No correlation IDs for tracing requests across services.

**Remediation:** Add request ID middleware for better traceability.

### üìå LOW-004: Insufficient Password Reset Security
Password reset doesn't implement additional verification steps.

**Remediation:** Add email confirmation and time limits for password resets.

### üìå LOW-005: Missing Content-Type Validation
No validation of Content-Type headers for API requests.

**Remediation:** Add Content-Type validation middleware.

### üìå LOW-006: No Request Size Limits Per Endpoint
Global 10MB limit may be too permissive for some endpoints.

**Remediation:** Implement endpoint-specific request size limits.
